            <h2>Where did Ronald McDonald come from?</h2>
            <p>Ronald McDonald (age unknown) was first sighted on July 4th, 1963 in Henderson, Nebraska, by a corn farmer who heard unsettling murmurs coming from nearby his grain silos. After inspection, the farmer found Ronald McDonald hunched over a moderately sized pile of raw corn cobs, feverishly gnawing on them. Ronald McDonald, becoming alerted by the farmers presence, fled the scene whilst producing a high-pitched screeching sound.</p>
            <p>The farmer later described Ronald McDonald as having "souless eyes, like those of something demonic" and being "erratic and disturbed in nature". Some theorists believe Ronald McDonald is an inter-dimensional being, capable of travelling through time and space at will.</p>
            <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Ronald McDonald has voluntarily particpated in numerous scientific studies. <i>Hawking, et al</i> have described Ronald McDonald as having "the perfect metabolic system" whereby his physical body adapts with great ease to internal and external factors. Due to this, he is able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consume very little food or water and survive for months at a time</li>
                <li>Breathe underwater and in space</li>
                <li>Never sleep</li>
            </ul>
